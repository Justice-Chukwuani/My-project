             <p> If you have read any of my stories, you must have noticed that I don't write stories so well. For this reason, I have decided to forget about writing stories and focus more on writing computer codes and programs. Perhaps, in no time I will be able to simple declare a function that will perform the tast of writing the stories for me. </p>
